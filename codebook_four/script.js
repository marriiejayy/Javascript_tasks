// Practice exercise one
// Task: Movie Collection Tracker  

// Requirements:
// 1. Create an object `movie` with properties: `title`, `director`, `releaseYear`, and `rating`  
let movie = {
    title: "Inception",
    director: "Christopher Nolan",
    releaseYear: 2010,

    // 2. Add a method `getSummary()` that returns a string 

    getSummary() {
        return (`"${this.title} (${this.releaseYear}), directed by ${this.title}, rated ${this.rating}/10"`)
    }
};
console.log("Summary:", movie.getSummary());

// 3. Add a new property `isWatched` and update it to `true`
movie.isWatched = true;
console.log("Updated movie:", movie)

// Challenge:
// Create an array of at least 3 movies and write a function to display only the movies with `rating â‰¥ 8`.
